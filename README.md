README
========================================================

Created May 2014, M. Beck, beck.marcus@epa.gov

The contents of this respository include materials for creating a standalone workflow using Pandoc to integrate R with MS products, just open 'pan_flow.Rproj' and run the 'master.r'.

Note that the reports will not compile if you do not have the required software (see 'pan_flow.pdf')

The input data, 'my_data.xlsx', are included although the workflow imports the spreadsheet from an online source.

Additional files include those used to create a pdf presentation ('pan_flow.pdf') describing use of these materials.
